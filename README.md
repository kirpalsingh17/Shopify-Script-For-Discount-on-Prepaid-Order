<h2>What is Shopify scripts?</h2>
<p>Shopify scripts are written in Ruby which gave us permission to create new users experience. Using <b>Line item, Shipping Method & Payment Methods</b> scripts you can implement custom logic and tailor the user experience during a user’s checkout experience. Scripts are enabled on a store’s checkout by using the Script Editor app.</p>

<h2>How to use Shopify scripts?</h2>
<p>Use the <b>Script Editor App</b> to create, edit, test, and publish your scripts.</p>
<p>Only one script per script type can be published at one time. For example, you can publish a line items script and a shipping rates script, but you can't publish two line items scripts at the same time.</p>
